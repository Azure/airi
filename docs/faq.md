### How do I set up my environment to use the AI Reference Implementation?

To set up your environment, you need to install Terraform and Azure CLI, authenticate with Azure, and ensure your system meets all the prerequisites. Detailed steps are available in the [Environment Setup](./environment_setup.md) guide.

## Usage

### How do I deploy the AI Reference Implementation?

To deploy AIRI, follow these steps:

1. Assess your AI scenario to determine the specific configurations needed.
2. Set up your environment as outlined in the [Environment Setup](./environment_setup.md) guide.
3. Create a Terraform project that references the AIRI module, configure the necessary variables, and apply the Terraform configuration.

For a step-by-step guide, see the [Getting Started](./getting_started.md) documentation.

### Can I customize the deployment?

Yes, AIRI is highly modular and can be customized to fit your specific needs. You can enable or disable various components, configure security and observability settings, and integrate additional Azure services as required. Refer to the pattern module documentation for details on available variables and customization options.

## Troubleshooting

### What should I do if I encounter an issue during deployment?

If you encounter any issues during deployment:

1. Review the error messages provided by Terraform to identify the root cause.
2. Check the [Troubleshooting guide](./troubleshooting.md) for common issues and solutions.
3. If the issue persists, search the existing issues in the GitHub repository to see if it has already been reported.

### How do I report a bug or request a feature?

To report a bug or request a feature, please use the GitHub Issues section of the repository:

1. Search existing issues to avoid duplicates.
2. If your issue or request is not listed, create a new issue with detailed information.

For more details, see the [Support doc](../SUPPORT.md).

## Security

### How is security handled in the AI Reference Implementation?

Security is a core component of AIRI. The reference implementation includes built-in security measures such as:

* Network isolation through private endpoints and virtual networks.
* Identity and access management using Azure Active Directory and managed identities.
* Data protection with encryption at rest and in transit.

For more detailed information, please refer to the [Security Overview](./security/security_overview.md) documentation.

### Is the AI Reference Implementation compliant with industry standards?

Yes, AIRI is designed to comply with industry standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, and ISO 27001. The implementation follows Azure’s best practices for security and compliance, making it easier to meet regulatory requirements.

For more details on compliance, see the [Compliance](./security/compliance.md) documentation.

## Observability

### How can I monitor the performance of my AI environment?

AIRI includes integrated observability tools that allow you to monitor the performance and health of your AI environment. This includes:

* Centralized logging using Azure Monitor Logs.
* Real-time metrics through Azure Monitor Metrics.
* Customizable alerts to notify you of performance issues or failures.

For more information, see the [Observability Overview](./observability/observability_overview.md) documentation.

### How do I set up alerts and monitoring?

Alerts and monitoring are configured as part of the AIRI deployment. You can customize these settings to match your specific needs, such as adjusting thresholds or integrating with third-party notification systems.

For detailed instructions, refer to the [Monitoring](./observability/monitoring.md) and [Alerting](./observability/alerting.md) guides.
