# Security Overview

## Introduction

Security is a top priority in the AI Reference Implementation (AIRI). This document provides an overview of the security practices and features integrated into AIRI, ensuring that your AI deployments on Azure are secure, compliant, and resilient against potential threats. The implementation follows Azure’s Well-Architected Framework and incorporates best practices to protect your resources and data.

**Note:** All resources deployed by AIRI are configured to be private-only, meaning they are not exposed to the public internet. This is a fundamental requirement of the project and cannot be changed, ensuring that your AI environment remains isolated and secure.

## Core Security Principles

AIRI is built around the following core security principles:

- **Least Privilege:** Access to resources is restricted to the minimum necessary, following the principle of least privilege. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and managed identities are used to ensure that only authorized users and services can access sensitive resources.

- **Defense in Depth:** Multiple layers of security are applied across the environment, including network isolation, encryption, and identity management. This approach minimizes the risk of a single point of failure.

- **Security by Default:** The implementation is configured with secure defaults, reducing the need for manual security configurations and minimizing the risk of misconfigurations.

- **Compliance:** The implementation is designed to meet various industry standards and regulatory requirements, including GDPR, HIPAA, and ISO 27001, making it easier for organizations to maintain compliance.

## Identity and Access Management

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

AIRI utilizes Azure's RBAC to control access to resources. Users and services are granted the minimum permissions required to perform their tasks, ensuring that critical resources are protected from unauthorized access.

- **Custom Roles:** In addition to built-in roles, custom roles can be defined to provide more granular access control.
- **Managed Identities:** Azure Managed Identities are used to securely authenticate and access other Azure services without the need for credentials stored in code.

For more details on identity and access management, please refer to the [Identity and Access Management](./identity_and_access_management.md) document.

### Azure Active Directory (AAD) Integration

AIRI integrates with Azure Active Directory for centralized identity management and authentication. This allows organizations to enforce policies such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) and conditional access, enhancing the overall security posture.

## Network Security

### Virtual Networks and Subnet Segmentation

AIRI deploys resources within isolated Virtual Networks (VNets), allowing for fine-grained control over network traffic. Subnets are used to segment different types of resources, such as compute and storage, further enhancing security.

### Private Endpoints

All resources deployed by AIRI are configured with private endpoints, ensuring that traffic between resources remains within the Azure network and is not exposed to the public internet. This approach reduces the attack surface and enhances data security.

### Network Security Groups (NSGs)

NSGs are applied to subnets and individual resources to control inbound and outbound traffic based on rules defined by the organization. This helps in protecting resources from unauthorized access and potential threats.

For a detailed explanation of network security configurations, please see the [Network Security](./network_security.md) document.

## Data Protection

### Encryption

Data protection is a key component of AIRI's security strategy. The following encryption mechanisms are implemented:

- **Encryption at Rest:** All data stored in Azure services is encrypted at rest using Azure Storage Service Encryption (SSE) with either Microsoft-managed keys or customer-managed keys (CMK).
- **Encryption in Transit:** Data in transit between services is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS), ensuring that sensitive information is protected during communication.

### Azure Key Vault Integration

Azure Key Vault is used to securely store and manage sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, and certificates. Access to Key Vault is tightly controlled using managed identities and RBAC, ensuring that only authorized entities can access or manage secrets.

For more detailed information on data protection practices, please refer to the [Data Protection](./data_protection.md) document.

## Compliance and Monitoring

### Azure Security Center

AIRI integrates with Azure Security Center to continuously monitor the security posture of your AI environment. Security Center provides:

- **Security Recommendations:** Proactive recommendations to improve security configurations and reduce vulnerabilities.
- **Advanced Threat Protection:** Alerts and mitigations for potential threats such as brute-force attacks and suspicious activities.

### Compliance Policies

AIRI is designed to help organizations meet compliance requirements. Azure Policy can be used to enforce compliance with industry standards, and built-in initiatives can be applied to automatically audit and remediate non-compliant resources.

For more information on compliance, see the [Compliance](./compliance.md) document.

## Best Practices

To further enhance the security of your AI environment, consider the following best practices:

- **Regular Security Audits:** Periodically review and audit security configurations and access controls to ensure they meet your organization’s security policies.
- **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA for all users accessing the environment to add an additional layer of security.
- **Monitor Logs and Alerts:** Continuously monitor security logs and alerts using Azure Monitor and Security Center to detect and respond to potential threats promptly.
- **Patch Management:** Keep all deployed resources up to date with the latest security patches. Use Azure Automation or Update Management to automate patching.

## Conclusion

Security is an integral part of the AI Reference Implementation, with robust features and practices designed to protect your AI environment on Azure. By following the principles of least privilege, defense in depth, and security by default, AIRI provides a secure foundation for deploying AI solutions that meet industry standards and regulatory requirements.
