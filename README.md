# AI Reference Implementation

## Overview

The AI Reference Implementation (AIRI) is a modular, scalable, and secure framework designed to accelerate the deployment of AI solutions on Azure. AIRI provides a pre-configured, best-practice approach that integrates seamlessly with Azureâ€™s suite of services, enabling data scientists, engineers, and organizations to rapidly build and deploy AI applications.

### Key Features

- **Modularity:** Customize the implementation to fit your specific project needs with modular components.
- **Security by Design:** Built-in security best practices, including private endpoints, encryption, and role-based access control.
- **Observability:** Integrated tools for real-time monitoring, logging, and alerting, ensuring a fully observable AI environment.
- **Scalability:** Supports scaling from small proofs of concept to large-scale, production AI deployments.
- **Compliance:** Designed to meet industry standards and regulatory requirements, such as GDPR, HIPAA, and ISO 27001.

## Getting Started

To start using AIRI, follow these steps:

1. **Assess Your AI Scenario:** Determine the specific AI use case you want to implement. Examples and templates are available in the `examples/` directory.
2. **Set Up Your Environment:** Follow the instructions in the [Environment Setup](./docs/environment_setup.md) guide to install the necessary tools and authenticate with Azure.
3. **Deploy the Implementation:** Use Terraform to deploy AIRI by referencing the module and configuring it according to your needs. Detailed steps can be found in the [Getting Started](./docs/getting_started.md) guide.
