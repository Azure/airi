# Contributing to the AI Reference Implementation

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the AI Reference Implementation (AIRI)! We welcome contributions from the community and are grateful for your help in improving this project. This document outlines the process for contributing, including submitting issues, making changes, and following our code of conduct.

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork the Repository

Start by forking the repository to your own GitHub account. This allows you to freely experiment with your changes without affecting the original project.

### 2. Clone Your Fork

Once you have forked the repository, clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/airi
cd airi
```

### 3. Set Up Your Environment

Ensure your development environment is properly set up by following the instructions in the [Environment Setup](../docs/environment_setup.md) guide.

### 4. Create a Branch

Before making any changes, create a new branch for your work:

```bash
git checkout -b your-feature-branch-name
```

Use a descriptive name for your branch that reflects the changes you plan to make.

## Making Changes

### 1. Code Standards

Please follow the existing coding standards and conventions used in the project. Consistent code helps maintain readability and reduces the likelihood of introducing errors.

### 2. Writing Tests

If applicable, write tests for any new features or bug fixes. Tests help ensure that your changes work as expected and don't unintentionally break existing functionality.

### 3. Documentation

Update the relevant documentation files to reflect any changes you make. This includes modifying the `README.md`, `docs/`, and any other relevant documentation to ensure that it accurately describes the current state of the project.

## Submitting Your Changes

### 1. Commit Your Changes

Commit your changes to your branch with a descriptive commit message:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Description of your changes"
```

### 2. Push to GitHub

Push your changes to your fork on GitHub:

```bash
git push origin your-feature-branch-name
```

### 3. Create a Pull Request

Navigate to the original repository on GitHub and create a pull request (PR) from your forked repository. Provide a clear description of your changes and any relevant context or issues that your PR addresses.

### 4. Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Most contributions require you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). When you submit your pull request, a CLA bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide a CLA and guide you through the process. You will only need to do this once across all Microsoft repositories.

## Code Review Process

Your pull request will be reviewed by the project maintainers. They may suggest changes or improvements, and you should be prepared to update your PR based on their feedback. Once your PR is approved, it will be merged into the main branch.
